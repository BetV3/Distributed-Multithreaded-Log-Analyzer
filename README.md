## Project Overview

**Objective**  
Create a **distributed, concurrent system** that splits up a large workload—namely, **log analysis**—across multiple machines using a **mini-MapReduce** paradigm. By distributing tasks, we aim to **improve performance** and **scalability** for log parsing, aggregation, and analytics.

**Core Technologies**  
- **Language**: [Go](https://go.dev/) (chosen for simplicity, built-in concurrency features via goroutines, and strong performance).  
- **Communications**: [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) for high-performance inter-node communication.  
- **Data Handling**: Optional shared data store or queue system (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) if required for coordination and state management (to be decided as the project evolves).

**Mini-MapReduce Concept**  
- **Map Phase**: Each node processes chunks of log data (e.g., parsing out fields, filtering, or summarizing errors).  
- **Reduce Phase**: Aggregate partial results (e.g., total error counts, request frequencies) into a final global output.

---

## Phase 1: Requirements & Feasibility

1. **Define Use Cases & Workloads**  
   - Primary workload: **Log analysis** (e.g., parse Apache/Nginx logs, NASA logs, or any large log files).  
   - Determine expected throughput (e.g., lines/second) and log size (megabytes to gigabytes).

2. **Functional & Non-Functional Requirements**  
   - **Functional**:  
     - Ability to split large log files into smaller chunks.  
     - Process each chunk on a separate node.  
     - Produce aggregated metrics (e.g., request counts, top endpoints, error rates).  
   - **Non-Functional**:  
     - Throughput target: X lines/second.  
     - Latency requirements: results or partial updates in Y seconds.  
     - Availability: 99.9% uptime.  
     - Scalability: handle 2× load within 5 minutes by adding nodes.

3. **Feasibility Study**  
   - Validate Go’s concurrency model (goroutines, channels) plus gRPC can handle the scale.  
   - Rough plan for initial number of machines (e.g., 3–5 nodes). Expand to more if needed.

4. **Success Criteria**  
   - Dynamically distribute log processing tasks to multiple nodes.  
   - Show near-linear performance improvements by adding nodes.

**Deliverables**  
- **Requirements document** detailing functional and non-functional requirements.  
- **Feasibility & technology validation report** (simple proof-of-concept or notes on Go/gRPC performance for log processing).

## Phase 2: System Architecture & High-Level Design

1. **High-Level Architecture**  
   - **Master-Worker Model**: A master node orchestrates tasks, distributing log chunks to worker nodes.  
   - **Mini-MapReduce Flow**:  
     1. Master splits log files into chunks.  
     2. Worker nodes process chunks (Map).  
     3. Master (or a dedicated Reducer) aggregates partial results.  

2. **Communication & Protocol**  
   - Using **gRPC** for high-speed, type-safe inter-node communication.  
   - Define Protobuf schemas for `MapTask` and `ReduceTask`.

3. **Task Splitting Strategy**  
   - Divide large log files into chunk files or stream segments.  
   - Provide an interface in Go to handle chunk creation and ingestion.

4. **Concurrency Model**  
   - Within each worker node, use **goroutines** to parallelize parsing/analysis.  
   - Manage concurrency with channels, sync.WaitGroup, or worker pools.

5. **Load Balancing**  
   - Start with simple round-robin or random distribution of chunks.  
   - Potentially implement dynamic load balancing if certain nodes get overloaded.

6. **Data Persistence**  
   - If partial results or logs need storing, evaluate Redis or PostgreSQL for ephemeral or persistent storage.  
   - Decide on caching strategies to speed up repeated tasks (if needed).

**Deliverables**  
- **Architecture diagram(s)** (e.g., Master-Worker, message flows).  
- **Design specification document** describing communication protocols, concurrency, chunking, node roles.

## Phase 3: Prototyping the Core Concurrency & Task Splitting

1. **Local Prototype (Single Machine)**  
   - Write a **Go module** that splits a log file into smaller chunks.  
   - Use goroutines to concurrently parse these chunks.  
   - Validate performance is better than a single-thread approach.

2. **Error Handling & Retries**  
   - Test partial failures (e.g., goroutine panics).  
   - Implement minimal logging to track errors and possibly retry chunks.

3. **Performance Measurement**  
   - Use Go’s profiling tools (`go test -bench`, `pprof`) to measure CPU usage, memory usage, and concurrency overhead.  
   - Optimize concurrency patterns (e.g., worker pool size, chunk sizes).

**Deliverables**  
- **Concurrency test harness** (basic example code).  
- **Measurement results** and concurrency best practices doc.

## Phase 4: Inter-Machine Communication & Distributed Deployment

1. **Networking Layer Setup**  
   - Configure how nodes discover each other (static config, DNS, or service registry like Consul).  
   - Use **TLS** for secure gRPC connections (initially optional, recommended for production).

2. **Task Distribution Mechanism**  
   - **Push Model**: Master pushes tasks to workers.  
   - **Pull Model**: Workers request tasks from Master.  
   - Implement chunk splitting, distribution, and a way to track progress (e.g., which chunks are done).

3. **Scalability & Dynamic Joining**  
   - If a new node spins up, how does it register?  
   - If a node goes offline, how do we reassign its in-progress logs?

4. **Shared State / Coordination**  
   - If partial results require global state, consider a key-value store.  
   - Manage concurrency to avoid double-counting or missed chunks.

**Deliverables**  
- **Initial distributed version** with multiple nodes (Master + at least 2 Workers).  
- **gRPC Protobuf files** defining the service interfaces.  
- **Documentation** on node setup, discovery, and usage.

## Phase 5: Fault Tolerance, Monitoring, and Advanced Features

1. **Fault Tolerance**  
   - Add retry logic if a worker fails mid-chunk.  
   - Introduce checkpointing to track partially processed data.

2. **Node Health Checks & Heartbeats**  
   - Periodically check if workers are alive (e.g., health endpoint via gRPC).  
   - Deregister and reassign tasks if a node is unresponsive.

3. **Monitoring & Observability**  
   - Integrate logging platforms (ELK stack, Splunk) or aggregated logs in a dashboard.  
   - Expose metrics via **Prometheus** (tasks processed, average processing time, error counts).  
   - Set up alerts if processing falls behind or nodes drop.

4. **Load Balancing & Scheduling Optimizations**  
   - Explore advanced scheduling (prioritize smaller chunks, factor in node CPU usage).  
   - Optionally add a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, NATS) for asynchronous distribution.

5. **Security Considerations**  
   - Mutual TLS for all node communications.  
   - Encrypt logs at rest if needed (compliance or privacy reasons).

**Deliverables**  
- **Retry and checkpoint** mechanisms.  
- **Health check & monitoring** dashboards.  
- **Security strategy document**.

## Phase 6: Testing & Quality Assurance

1. **Unit & Integration Tests**  
   - Test concurrency logic (goroutines, channels).  
   - Test gRPC endpoints with mock data to ensure correct chunk assignment and results.

2. **Load & Stress Testing**  
   - Use large log datasets to push the system to its limits.  
   - Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage to identify bottlenecks.

3. **Failover & Recovery Testing**  
   - Bring down worker nodes mid-task to see if Master correctly reassigns chunks.  
   - Validate minimal or no data loss.

4. **Regression Testing**  
   - Each new feature must not break existing functionality.

**Deliverables**  
- **Automated test suite** (unit, integration, e2e).  
- **Load/stress test reports** showing performance under heavy workloads.  
- **QA checklist** documenting test coverage.

   - Containerize the application using **Docker** and orchestrate with **Kubernetes** or similar.

2. **Production Environment Setup**  
   - Choose a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure) or on-premises solution.  
   - Configure auto-scaling groups or Kubernetes autoscaling to handle spikes in log volume.

3. **Rollout Plan**  
   - Use **canary deployments** or blue-green strategies for minimal downtime.  
   - Monitoring and alerting in place before going live.

4. **Ongoing Maintenance**
